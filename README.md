A project for my University. I did Process, cleaning, calibration, visualization and analysis an astronomical image. 

it's essential to clean dust and light from different sources on the telescope len to have the real image of the nebula (1).

After I need analyze data to have the measure of light\magnitude of differents sources and then can get the real nebula magnitude (2).

2. Cleaning_Analysis_Visualization

* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Astropy
* Pandas
* Scipy
* Photutils
